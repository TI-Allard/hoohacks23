## Welcome to Recipe Finder!
Created for HooHacks 2023 by Tiara Allard and Brennen Muller.

This is a website developed using Django, [DATABASE], and HTML to search and display recipes. 
Each recipe contains an ingredients field, instructions field, and a time field.

To set up, create a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies in requirements.txt.
Recipes can be searched by title and ingredients.

This project aims to combat food waste by simplifying the process for creating meals with old 
ingredients and creating shopping lists.
